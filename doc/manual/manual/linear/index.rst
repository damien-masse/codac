Linear algebra
==============

Codac provides a set of functions for the decomposition and inversion of interval matrices. As Codac is based on the `Eigen library <https://eigen.tuxfamily.org>`_, some of the provided features adopt the structure of Eigen (same class name or operations) with an interval approach and reliable outputs.
