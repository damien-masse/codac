CAPD (rigorous numerics in dynamical systems)
=============================================

This page describes how to use the CAPD library with CODAC. CAPD is a C++ library for rigorous numerics in dynamical systems.

To use CAPD with CODAC, you first need to install the CAPD library. You can find the installation instructions on the `CAPD website <http://capd.ii.uj.edu.pl/html/capd_compilation.html>`_.

Note that as CAPD is a C++ only library, the content present in this page is **only available in C++**.

Installing the codac-capd extension
-----------------------------------

To install the codac-capd extension, you need to install the CODAC library from its source. To do so you can refer to :ref:`this page <sec-install-cpp>`.

To install the codac-capd, you need to add the option ``-DWITH_CAPD=ON`` to the CMake command. For example:


.. code-block:: bash

      cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/ibex-lib/build_install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_CAPD=ON ..

We highly recommend to test the installation of the library with the provided tests. To do so, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

      make test

Content
-------

The codac-capd extension provides functions to convert CAPD objects to CODAC objects and vice versa.

The functions are ``to_capd`` and ``to_codac``. They can be used to convert the following objects:

- capd::Interval <-> codac2::Interval
- capd::IVector <-> codac2::IntervalVector
- capd::IMatrix <-> codac2::IntervalMatrix

How to use
----------

The header of the codac-capd extension is not included by default. You need to include it manually in your code:

.. code-block:: c++

  #include <codac-capd.h>

You can use the functions ``to_capd`` and ``to_codac`` to convert between CAPD and CODAC objects as follows:

.. tabs::

  .. code-tab:: c++

    codac2::Interval codac_interval(0., 2.);  // CODAC interval [0, 2]
    capd::Interval capd_interval=to_capd(codac_interval); // convert to CAPD interval
    codac2::Interval codac_interval2=to_codac(capd_interval); // convert back to CODAC interval

Note that in order to use the CAPD library itself, its header must be included. The following line should then be added at the beginning of your code:

.. code-block:: c++

  #include <capd/capdlib.h>


Example
-------

.. image:: img/pendulum.png
   :alt: State variables of the pendulum
   :align: right
   :width: 130px


For this example we will consider the pendulum with friction.

The state variables of the pendulum are its angle :math:`\theta` and its angular velocity :math:`\omega`. The pendulum follows the following dynamic:

.. math::
  
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
  \dot{\theta}\\
  \dot{\omega}
  \end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
  \omega\\
  -\sin(\theta)\cdot\frac{g}{l}-0.5\omega
  \end{array}\right)
  

where :math:`g` is the gravity constant and :math:`l` is the length of the pendulum.

This equation can be passed to the CAPD library as follows:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: C++

    .. literalinclude:: src.cpp
      :language: c++
      :start-after: [codac-capd-2-beg]
      :end-before: [codac-capd-2-end]

To solve this ODE, an IOdeSolver object is necessary.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: C++

    .. literalinclude:: src.cpp
      :language: c++
      :start-after: [codac-capd-3-beg]
      :end-before: [codac-capd-3-end]

CAPD then uses an ``ITimeMap`` to make the link between a time step and the solution of the ODE at this time. The "I" here stands for Interval 
as the solution is an Interval guaranteed to enclose the solution. Here we will integrate the ODE between :math:`t_0=0s` and :math:`t_f=20s`.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: C++

    .. literalinclude:: src.cpp
      :language: c++
      :start-after: [codac-capd-4-beg]
      :end-before: [codac-capd-4-end]

To completly define the ODE, we need to define the initial conditions. Here we will set the initial angle to :math:`\theta_0=-\frac{\pi}{2}` and the 
initial angular velocity to :math:`\omega_0=0`. For the purpose of this example, we will add a small uncertainty to the initial conditions. The initial conditions are then defined as follows:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: C++

    .. literalinclude:: src.cpp
      :language: c++
      :start-after: [codac-capd-5-beg]
      :end-before: [codac-capd-5-end]

There are then two ways to get the result of the integration depending on the use case.

If the desired result is the solution of the ODE at a given time (here say :math:`T=1s`), we can do as follows:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: C++

    .. literalinclude:: src.cpp
      :language: c++
      :start-after: [codac-capd-6-beg]
      :end-before: [codac-capd-6-end]

**Be careful, this methods modifies the initial set s in place**

If the desired result is the solution curve (or tube) of the ODE on the time domain :math:`[t_0,t_f]`, we can do as follows:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: C++

    .. literalinclude:: src.cpp
      :language: c++
      :start-after: [codac-capd-7-beg]
      :end-before: [codac-capd-7-end]

The variable ``solution`` is the desired solution curve (or tube). The operator ``solution(t)`` gives the solution at time :math:`t`.

A full display can be done with the following code:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: C++

    .. literalinclude:: src.cpp
      :language: c++
      :start-after: [codac-capd-8-beg]
      :end-before: [codac-capd-8-end]
