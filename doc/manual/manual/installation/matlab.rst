Since 2019, MATLAB allows you to import Python packages into its environment. Codac offers a Python package dedicated to MATLAB, with the necessary adaptations to run in this environment (for example: indices starting at ``1``, alternatives to unsupported ``&`` and ``|`` operations, *etc.*). This Python package dedicated to MATLAB is called ``codac4matlab``. See `the related PyPI page <https://pypi.org/project/codac4matlab>`_.

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have MATLAB R2019b or later.
2. **Python integration**: Follow the instructions `here <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-supported-python-implementation.html>`_ to set up Python integration.
3. **Install the Python package**:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      pip install codac4matlab

Once Codac is installed, you can use it in your MATLAB scripts, ensuring proper integration with Python for functionality.
