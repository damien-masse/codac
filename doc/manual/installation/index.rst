Installation Guide
==================

Codac is available in both C++20 and Python3, as well as MATLAB `through its Python interface <https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-supported-python-implementation.html>`_. Note that if you want to contribute to Codac, you have to make the full C++ installation from sources.
